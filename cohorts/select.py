"""Select a vintage of the `injectable-generics` cohort. MANUAL, NEVER A CRON.

    python cohorts/select.py --selected-at 2026-09-03

Run it by hand, read the diff, commit it. Re-selecting on a schedule would
quietly delete every molecule that died between runs, which is the exact
survivorship failure the cohort machinery exists to prevent.

WHY A COHORT AT ALL. Q14 asks whether suppliers leave *before* a shortage or
after it. A panel of "drugs short today" can never answer that — by the time a
molecule qualifies, the exits already happened. So the population is the
at-risk one: injectable generics, short or not, followed forever.

    established  — top 300 injectable ANDA generics by marketed product count,
                   floor 3. The control group: mostly not short, and the only
                   way a pre-shortage exit is ever observed.
    new_entrant  — any molecule FDA has listed as short since --entrant-since,
                   at any size. This path is what stops the panel from being
                   only the drugs that were already big in 2026.

`entity_id` is the UPPERCASE active-ingredient string used to query Drugs@FDA,
verified to resolve before it is written. Ingredient names are messy and an
unverified one silently captures nothing.

COMBINATION PRODUCTS. FDA names a combination shortage by concatenating its
ingredients ("AMPICILLIN SODIUM SULBACTAM SODIUM"), which matches no single
`active_ingredients.name` and resolves to nothing. Rather than dropping them,
each is retried against the sub-phrases of its name and represented by the
one that resolves to the FEWEST products — the most specific ingredient, so
SULBACTAM SODIUM rather than AMPICILLIN.

`.exact` is the GATE, substring is the QUERY, and the distinction matters
both ways:

  - A substring match rewards meaningless fragments. "Fewest products" picked
    AMINO out of AMINO ACID and MONOHYDRATE out of DEXTROSE MONOHYDRATE,
    because rare fragments match few things. So a sub-phrase is only accepted
    if `.exact` says it is genuinely an ingredient name.
  - But `.exact` alone over-rejects. CEFOTAXIME is not an exact ingredient
    name — the ingredient is CEFOTAXIME SODIUM — so exact-only dropped the
    one drug in this repo with 100% supplier attrition. A full name that
    matches loosely is therefore kept as-is; only *fragments* need the gate.

On real ingredient names the two agree exactly (ATROPINE SULFATE: 71 either
way), so querying loosely costs nothing.

It is still a proxy for a combination: SULBACTAM SODIUM counts every product
whose ingredient is sulbactam sodium, which is nearly but not exactly the
ampicillin combination. A supplier-base trend for a closely related product
set, not an exact count for the combination itself.
