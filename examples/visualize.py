The test every figure here has to pass: **after reading it, can someone act
without running another query?** A count of drugs fails that test — it tells
you a number and sends you back for the names. So each figure names the
drugs, gives their therapeutic class, and puts the decision in the subtitle.

  whats-short.svg        Q1  which drugs, how long, what class — the stockpile list
  shortage-age.svg       Q1  age structure of the list: churn against a permanent core
  availability.svg       Q3  severity right now — which drugs have nothing available
  supplier-attrition.svg Q13 how many approved makers each shorted drug has left
  single-supplier.svg    Q7  drugs down to one listed package — the watchlist
  enforcement-year.svg   Q6  GMP import bans by year and origin — is the base shrinking
  escalation.svg         Q6b named plants where an OAI was followed by an action/recall
  inspection-capacity.svg Q6c volume vs OAI rate, 2009-2025 — the base is thinner
  shortage-duration.svg  Q2  deliberately empty until captures accrue
  supplier-exits.svg     Q14 deliberately empty until the cohort source is active

Charts read the derived table, never the raw archive. Stdlib only,
deterministic: the same observations always produce the same bytes.

Palette is the dataviz reference instance, categorical slots in fixed order,
validated (scripts/validate_palette.js): all checks pass with a contrast WARN
on three slots, which is why every mark carries a visible text label.
