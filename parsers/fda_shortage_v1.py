"""openFDA drug-shortage feed -> observations.

The feed is a snapshot of what is short *now*; resolved records leave it.
So every observation is a membership fact dated at capture time, and the
series only becomes answerable by accumulating those snapshots.

Purity rule: nothing here may depend on today's date. `first_listed` is
emitted as an absolute YYYYMMDD integer, never as an age, so re-deriving the
archive years from now reproduces byte-identical output.

Entity ids are composite — `drug:<generic>/ndc:<ndc11>` — because the feed is
paged. Emitting per-drug or per-status *counts* here would split them across
two endpoints and produce two rows with the same `observed_at` and different
values, ambiguous between "sum" and "latest". Every aggregate is a downstream
GROUP BY on the entity prefix instead.

`status_code`: 0 = Resolved, 1 = Current, 2 = To Be Discontinued.
`in_category`: a membership edge, `drug:<generic>/category:<therapeutic>` = 1.
A drug carries several categories, so this is a separate entity namespace
rather than a field — it is what lets a chart say *which* drugs and *what
class*, instead of only how many.

`is_injectable`: 1 if the dosage form is an injection. Categorical facts are
encoded as 0/1 metrics rather than left in the raw archive, so the repo's
headline finding (injectables are 7.6% of marketed products but 71% of
shortages) is reproducible from the published table alone.

One package NDC can carry several records (different presentations of the
same package, or a re-listing). They are merged per NDC, and where they
disagree the **worst** value wins: lowest availability, lowest status_code,
earliest first_listed, latest last_update. A package that any record calls
unavailable is not reliably available, and biasing the other way would let a
single optimistic row erase a live shortage.
